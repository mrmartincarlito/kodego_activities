              <span style="font-weight: 700;">:</span> Teaching The Teaching Track of the AB Philosophy program is envisioned as the suitable preparation and formation of students intending to teach philosophy courses in basic education as well as in the undergraduate level. This track of the Program is designed to inculcate in students the intellectual rigor of understanding philosophical concepts, tracing their historical antecedents and configurations, and developing them as tools for responding to contemporary challenges. At the same time, this track is aimed at forming the students as competent pedagogues, proficient in and versatile with various educational technologies and techniques, and imbued with the Ignatian values of sapientia, eloquentia, magis, and cura personalis.<br>
              <br>
              <span style="font-weight: 700;">Track 2</span>
              <span style="font-weight: 700;">:</span> Pre-Law With the arising challenges of the 21st century, anyone who endeavors to promote truth, justice, fairness, and equity in their profession must be equipped with the necessary qualities of critical analysis and insights, a passion and rigor for the pursuit of truth, commitment to the sovereignty of the rule of law, and most importantly a heart that is guided by conscience. These qualities will be honed and tempered through the guidance of a Jesuit education that places emphasis on Christ-centeredness, compassion, commitment to change, conscience, and competence. The philosophy program enables students to be inquisitive, critical and insightful thinkers, and conscientiously discerning thus able to emulate the core values needed for any professional career.<br>
              <br>Students of philosophy learn to read carefully, think independently, communicate clearly, argue cogently, spot fallacies, clarify muddled reasoning, and identify questionable assumptions. Hence, any student who wishes to pursue formal education in the legal profession will find it much advantageous to enter the Philosophy – Pre-law Program. While providing a basic education in philosophy, the pre-law track places emphasis on the philosophy of law, social and political philosophy, moral theory, and courses that engage the student in the use of language, grammar, and argumentation. It is designed for students intending to pursue an advanced degree in law. It provides ideal training in the skills required for close, critical reading of legal texts. Students with this sort of background are especially well-suited for law school and the practice of law. The analytical skills one learns in philosophy courses are useful for legal analysis and make one a competitive candidate for law school. Aside from this, any profession that requires critical thinking skills, an ability to communicate well and work out problems will be suitable for a philosophy major.<br>

Civil Engineering works are generally one-of-a-kind projects; they are often grand in scale; and they usually require cooperation among professionals of many different disciplines. The completion of a civil engineering project involves the solution of technical problems in which information from numerous sources and myriad non-technical factors play a significant role. Some of the most common examples of civil engineering works include bridges, buildings, dams, airports and hangars, ports and harbors, highways and railways, tunnels, river and shore improvement, lighthouses, dry docks, irrigations, flood protection, drainage, water supply, and towers. Civil Engineering is one of the broadest engineering disciplines both in terms of the range of problems that fall within its purview and in the range of knowledge required to solve those problems.</p>

Because of the rapid pace of change in the computing field, computer engineers must be life – long learners to maintain their knowledge and skills within their chosen discipline.<br>
              <br>An important distinction should be made between computer engineers, electrical engineers, other computer professionals and engineering technologists. While such distinctions are sometimes ambiguous, computer engineers should satisfy the following three characteristics: (1) Posses the ability to design computers, computer – based systems and networks that include both hardware and software and their integration to solve novel engineering problems, subject to trade – offs involving a set of competing goals and constraints. In this context, “design” refers to a level of ability beyond “assembling” or “configuring” systems; (2) Have a breadth of knowledge in mathematics and engineering sciences, associated with the broader scope of engineering and beyond that narrowly required for the field; (3) Acquire and maintain a preparation for professional practice in engineering.<br>
